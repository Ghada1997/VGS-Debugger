# VGS Club Management Platform (MERN Stack)

This repository is a fork of a collaborative university project I worked on. It was developed as part of the software engineering course at **The German University in Cairo (GUC)** for **Vector Game Studio (VGS)** student club.  
The platform enables VGS members to manage internal activities including club applications, voting, and administrative workflows.
